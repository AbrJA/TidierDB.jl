# ## DuckDB's SUMMARIZE
# DuckDB has a feature tosummarize tables that gives information about the table, such as mean, std, q25, q75 etc.
# To use this feature with TidierDB, simply call an empty `@summarize`. 
@chain t(dfv) @summarize() @collect

# ## show_query/collect
# If you find yourself frequently showing a query while collecting, you can define the following function 
sqc(qry) = @chain t(qry) begin
                @aside @show_query _
                @collect()
            end;

# Call this function at the end of a chain similar the `@show_query` or`@collect` macros
@chain t(dfv) @summarize() sqc()
