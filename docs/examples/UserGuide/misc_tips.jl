# ## DuckDB's SUMMARIZE
# DuckDB has a feature tosummarize tables that gives information about the table, such as mean, std, q25, q75 etc.
# To use this feature with TidierDB, simply call an empty `@summarize`. 
@chain dfv @summarize() @collect

# ## show_query/collect
# If you find yourself frequently showing a query while collecting, you can define the following function 
sqc(qry) = @chain qry begin
                @aside @show_query _
                @collect()
            end;

# Call this function at the end of a chain similar the `@show_query` or`@collect` macros
# _printed query is not seen here as it prints to the REPL_
#@chain dfv @summarize() sqc()

# ## Color Printing
# Queries print with some code words in color to the REPL. To turn off this feature, run one of the following.
#   - `TidierDB.color[] = false`
#   - `DB.color[] = false`
